# Flop Films

Flop Films is a random B-movie generator that simplifies the process of choosing a bad movie and finding a streaming service to watch it on. 

## Usage

From the 'Pick A Flop' sections you can specify your movie search criteria by genre, release date, MPAA rating, and how bad you want the movie to be (broken down into categories of 'Bad', 'REALLY Bad', and 'Crimes Against Humanity'). When your criteria are set click the 'Click At Your Own Risk' button. A modal appears containing up to 20 different movie options based on your criteria. Included with each movie title is an image of the movie's poster, title, release date, plot description, and links to streaming services where the movie can we watched (if available).
